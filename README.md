# Twin Primes counter using OpenMP
A twin prime calculator implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes with concurrency implemented through OpenMP

## Usage
```
./main
```

## Requirements
* On Linux
    * g++
        * This can be installed using 
            * `sudo apt install g++`

* On Mac
    * OpenMP
        * Can be installed using Homebrew by running 
            * `brew install llvm`
            * `brew install libomp`
                * Brew can be installed from the official page [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
    * Clang++
        * Part of Xcode. This can be installed from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

## Building
The file can be compiled by running Make on the makefile. This will produce an executable named `main` \
Additionally, Doxygen documentation can be generated by running `Make DOXY`

## Files
* main.cpp
    * Contains the source for the project

* Makefile
    * Build tool use in development.
    * Can be executed by calling `make`

* Doxyfile
    * Doxygen project file. 
    * Contains information on the project and how to generate the documentation

* Specification.pdf
    * This is the specification for the project

* Project Report
    * Final submission of the required report
